# Gluon 

```f#
io.println "Hello World!"
```

By Markus Westerlind

???

Introduction

Small programming language, why and how I wrote it in Rust

Hope that this gives a good mix of gluon-the-language and how Rust works with it

---

# Gluon

???

Think you already know what Rust is, I will start with a short introduction to gluon

--

* Static typing with type inference

```f#
let double x = x * 2
double // double : Int -> Int
```

???

Super short, statically typed Lua

--

* Thread safe and concurrent

```rust
let vm = gluon::new_vm();
::std::thread::spawn(|| vm.run_expr(...))
```

--

* Strings are UTF-8 by default

```f#
io.println "ðŸ˜€"
```

???

Mimick Rust, do it correctly from the start

---

# Gluon

* Easy embedding

```rust
    vm.define_global("float",
                       record!(
        infinity => f64::INFINITY,
        pi => f64::consts::PI,
        radix => f64::RADIX,
        is_nan => primitive!(1 f64::is_nan),
        round => primitive!(1 f64::round),
        trunc => primitive!(1 f64::trunc),
    });

// Gluon
// float.round float.pi
```

---

```f#
let factorial n =
    if n < 2
    then 1
    else n * factorial (n - 1)

// `type` is used to declare a new type.
// In this case we declare `Countable` to be a record with a single field (count) which is a function
// taking a single argument and returning an integer
type Countable a = { count : a -> Int }

// "Counting" an integer just means returning the integer itself
let countable_Int : Countable Int = { count = \x -> x }

let list_module = /* ... */

// Bring the `List` type and its constructors into scope
let { List, countable_List } = list_module

// Create a `Countable` record for `List Int`
let { count } : Countable (List Int) = countable_List countable_Int

if count (Cons 20 (Cons 22 Nil)) == 41 then
    error "This branch is not executed"
else
    io.print "Hello world!"
```

# Parser

???

Back when I started working in rust, Crate eco system barely existed (existed at all?)

--

Started with a handwritten recursive descent parser

```rust
fn parse_expr(&mut self) -> Expr {
  match self.next_token() {
    Integer() => Expr::Integer(..),
    OpenParen => {
      let e = self.parse_expr();
      self.expect(CloseParen);
      e
    }
    ...
  }
}
```

--

Extremely flexible

--

Common patterns such as repetition or optional element are duplicated

--

Good error messages takes extra effort

---

## Combine

Built my own parser combinator library

???

nom

Readability is reasonable without needing external tools

Errors are mostly automatic (expected letter)

--

Parser combinators are small composable functions

```rust
extern crate combine;
use combine::{many, Parser};
use combine::char::letter;

let result = many1(letter()).parse("hello world");
assert_eq!(result, Ok(("hello".to_string(), " world")));
```

## LALRPOP

```
grammar;

AtomicExpr: Expr = {
    <id: Ident> =>
        Expr::Ident(TypedIdent::new(id)),

    <expr: AtomicExpr> "." <id: Ident> =>
        Expr::Projection(Box::new(expr), id, Type::hole()),

    "(" <elems: Comma<SpExpr>> ")" => ...,

    ...
};
```

.footnote[https://github.com/nikomatsakis/lalrpop]

???

Easier to read and update

Changed last autumn, crate eco system in a much better place!

--

Generates Rust code

---

## LALRPOP

```
grammar;

AtomicExpr: Expr = {
    <id: Ident> =>
        Expr::Ident(TypedIdent::new(id)),

    <expr: AtomicExpr> "." <id: Ident> =>
        Expr::Projection(Box::new(expr), id, Type::hole()),

*    <expr: AtomicExpr> "." <err: !> => {
*        errors.push(err.error);
*        Expr::Projection(Box::new(expr), env.from_str(""), Type::hole())
*    },

    "(" <elems: Comma<SpExpr>> ")" => ...,

    ...
};
```

Not only easier to read. Supports things like error recovery.

Necessary for reporting errors on unfinish code, auto completion

---

# Typechecking

???

Most distinctive part of gluon

Some loss of flexibility which is useful for scripting.
But one instead gains type safety in the api layer

Might pay off, might not

--

Hindley-Milner typesystem

???

Type unification quite elegant

--

Largely similiar to Rust's typesystem

???

Similarity to Rust important since we want to map as much of Rust as possible into the language

---

# Typechecking - Not so rusty

Typechecking allocates a lot of type values

???

Each expression has a type

Need to share type instances as much as possible

Difficult due to Rust's strict ownership rules.

`&T` simplest, rustc does this, arena allocated. Need to deallocated unused instances since the virtual machine is persistent.

`Rc<T>` works, reasonably fast, used it for a while, need `Arc<T>` for the vm to be thread safe, rust forces this to be explicit.

`Arc<T>` may be more expensive than necessary otherwise (atomic operations)

--

Need to share instances as much as possible

--

`&T`?
--
  No, Need a long lived object

--

`Rc<T>`
--
  Almost, does not work when considering threaded programs

--
  
`Arc<T>`
--
  Works! (But atomic operations makes it more expensive)

---

# Virtual machine

???

The main reason for choosing Rust in the first place. Embedded programs

Async -> Futures, Tokio

--

Runs bytecode
--

* Garbage collected

--

* Easy FFI

--

*  Asynchronous functions

---
name: segfault-machine

# Segfault machine

Almost all `unsafe` code is in the virtual machine

???

Garbage collection is inherently unsafe since Rust has no understandig of it

1st, accidently allocated to little memory in a garbage collector test

2nd, Did not limit the amount of stack space gluon program could use causing OOM

Running arbitrary code, requires:
  Locking down which functions can be called -> Pure language, IO only runs when explicitly asked

3rd, Stored short lived values in a long lived table 

--

3 segfaults slipped through

--

```rust
-            elems.len() * mem::size_of::<ElementType>()
+            mem::size_of::<VecType>()
```

--

```f#
let stackoverflow x =
    x + stackoverflow x

stackoverflow 123
```

--

```f#
let vm = new_vm();
{
  let child_vm = vm.new_child_vm();
  vm.store(child_vm.alloc_value());
  // child_vm's values are destroyed
}
```

# Tooling

???

Things I didn't think I'd end up doing at the start, but turned crucial and interesting.

Parts are written in gluon and I want to port more things over time.

## REPL

???

Great focus on cross-platform libraries, Using Rustyline to read lines, save history

## Language server

[Language server protocol](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2016/06/27/common-language-protocol#_how-it-works)

???

Created last summer

Most popular languages have some level of language server support

Can use any editor with any language

Had started to think I should use the static type information, Micrsoft + VS Code announced
language server a few weeks later.

Needed to build some plumbing myself at the start, but not there are several projects using
it in Rust (RLS)

Code formatting

Currently Rust backend and Elm front end.

Want to rewrite the rust backend into gluon. (http example)
